Q: "Why are you interested in taking CMSC320?"

A: I have been interested in math for most of 
my life, and after gaining an interest in computer 
science as well, I realized that Data Science was 
a combination of the two. This is also a growing 
field, so I want to find out if this potential 
career path is for me.
